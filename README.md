## Overview and Project Goal

Suppose we have independent observations of success (has diabetes) or failure (has no diabetes)
from a data set taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/diabetes-data-set). We can use MLE to conduct an inference on $p$. Since the MLEs do not have a closed form solution, we will try to solve using MCMC sampling by allowing for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ to each have normal distribution priors. With the $R$ ratio and the jumping distribution, implement a MCMC sampler to Obtain posterior distributions for the parameters as well as the posterior statistics and their credible intervals. 

Finally, Improve the MCMC algorithm and compare the burn-in used (MCMC MH Bivariate Manner).
